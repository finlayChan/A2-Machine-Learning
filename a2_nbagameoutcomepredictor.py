# **Problem Statement**

With the start of the 2025-26 season approaching, there is a big question circling the NBA community. Who is going to win. As of recently, the NBA has been at an all-time high of parody. With 7 different champions if the past 7 years. This makes it extremely hard to predict who will win. Factors such as injuries, off-season acquisitions, staff changes, and salary cap's all come into play. By combining an expertise on basketball with advanced data analytics and machine learning, this studdy offers a comprehensive guide for fans, amnd even teams, to make well-informed, data-supported predictions on the outcome of games.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to build a supervised machine learning model that predicts the outcome of professional basketball games (win or loss) using historical team and game statistics. The model should find features from two different datasets to find the most important features that affect the outcome of the game and utilise them to make the best possible prediction. The goal is to evaluate the model’s predictive performance and generalization to real-world games, demonstrating how data-driven learning can enhance sports outcome analysis.

### Inputs

The inputs for this project are historical team and game statistics from the provided datasets, specifically focusing on games from 2022 onwards. These inputs are used to train the machine learning model to predict game outcomes. The datasets used are:

- **hamzas/nba-games (games):** This dataset contains game-level information for NBA games.
- **hamzas/nba-games (games_details):** This dataset contains player-level statistics for NBA games.

### Outputs

The output of the model will be a prediction of the outcome for each game (win or loss for the home team). This prediction will be based on the historical data and the features the model learns are most important.

Install three Python libraries using pip:

**datasets:** This library provides easy access to a wide variety of datasets, which can be useful for machine learning and data analysis tasks.

**pandas:** A library for data manipulation and analysis.

**scikit-learn:** A machine learning library with various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering etc.

Prediction Accuracy improved from 74.9 (model 5) --> 76.5%

# RESULTS & SUMMARY


We started by loading NBA game data and establishing a baseline prediction accuracy based on the historical home win rate (55.8%). We then progressively built several Random Forest models, starting with basic game information (Model 1), adding engineered team strength features (Model 2), and tuning hyperparameters (Model 3). These steps gradually improved the accuracy.

The most significant improvement came from incorporating aggregated player starter statistics (Model 5), which boosted accuracy to 74.9%. Finally, applying hyperparameter tuning to this model (Model 6) resulted in the best performance, with a test accuracy of 76.5% and a ROC-AUC of 0.845.

The result compares quite well to the state-of-the-art recent academic findings on predicting NBA games: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357926/#Sec22

This demonstrates that including player-level performance data, in addition to team-level and game information, is highly valuable for predicting NBA game outcomes, and hyperparameter tuning further enhances the model's effectiveness.

We have successfully built a model that significantly outperforms the baseline in predicting NBA game wins.
